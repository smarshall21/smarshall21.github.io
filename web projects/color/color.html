    <h2>Subtractive</h2>
	<p>A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others.</p>

	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful : The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.</p>

	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p>Cathode ray tube, LCD, plasma and LED displays all utilize the RGB model. In order to create a color with RGB, three colored light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed. With no intensity,each of the three colors is perceived as black, while full intensity leads to a perception of seeing white.</p>
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
	<p>Analogous (uh-NAL-uh-gus) colors sit next to each other on the color wheel. They tend to look pleasant together because they are closely related.</p>
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>Monochromatic colors are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue. Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints.</p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>Choose one color to dominate, a second to support. The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent. A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
	<p>Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined, cancel each other out. This means that when combined, they produce a grey-scale color like white or black. When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those particular two colors.</p>
