<h1>The Brave Tin Soldier</h1>

<body background="imgs/tin.png">

	<p>There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers,<br> who were all brothers, for they had been made <br> out of the same old tin spoon.  They shouldered <br> arms and looked straight before them, and wore <br>a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing <br> in the world they ever heard were the words,<br> "Tin soldiers!" uttered by a little boy, who clapped <br>
    his hands with delight when the lid of the<br> box, in which they lay, was taken off.<br> They were given him for a birthday <br>present, and he stood at the table to set <br> them up. The soldiers were all exactly <br> alike, excepting one, who had only one <br> leg; he had been left to the last, and then <br> there was not enough of the melted tin to<br> finish him, so they made him to stand firmly <br>
     on one leg, and this caused him to be <br> very remarkable.</p>
